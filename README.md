# GitHub Repos

A small app to display github repos for practice at The Iron Yard.

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, then run an http server in the `src/` directory. Be sure to type in GitHub [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) to authenticate with GitHub.

The objective of the first part of this project is to create a directive that can be used on other pages of this site in the future anytime I want to show a repository. This app already had a GitHub personal access token and retrieves a list of repositories for the given user. The directive should use Bootstrap's "panels" with a header and body. This new directive should be used in the existing template instead of the current ul/li structure.

The objective of the second part of this project is to practice building custom filters for my data. These filters come into play all over large applications when transforming some data from one format - or one order - to another. By the end of this assignment I should have a better grasp of how to create - and use - custom filters in my own applications, both for simple data and for arrays.

This project was forked from TIYDC GitHub repository for my Front End Class at The Iron Yard DC.
